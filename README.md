# Information Sharing in Second Price Auctions

## Summary

This research offers a joint consideration to two distinct problems in second-price auctions with common values: seller's optimal supply of information precision and bidders' incentive to acquire information. Normality assumption is adopted to allow for the utilization of different notions of stochastic ordering of signals simultaneously in a highly tractable learning environment. The main contribution is aimed to be enabling cooperative behavior among bidders through introduction of an \textit{information pool}. Resulting environment can potentially lead to novel strategic considerations between the seller and the bidders who aim to capture larger shares of the total surplus.
